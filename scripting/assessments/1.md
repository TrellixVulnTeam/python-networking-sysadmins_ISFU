--------------------------------------------------------

1.  An iterator is an object that can be iterated upon. It is an object
    that will return data, one element at a time. A generator is a
    function that returns an object that we can iterate over.
2.  Lists are mutable.
3.  Data structures in Python are structures that can hold some data
    together. In other words, they are used to store a collection of
    related data.
4.  We can access the values from a list by using index values.
5.  Modules are just files that contain Python statements and
    definitions.
