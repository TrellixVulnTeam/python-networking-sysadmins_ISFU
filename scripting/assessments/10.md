Lab 10,Â Basic Networking -- Socket Programming
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Socket programming involves writing computer programs that enable
    processes to communicate with each other across a computer network.
2.  In distributed computing, a remote procedure call is when a computer
    program causes a procedure to execute in a different address space,
    which is coded as if it were a normal procedure call, without the
    programmer explicitly coding the details for the remote interaction.
3.  Following is the answer:

```
import filename (import file)
from filename import function1 (import specific function)
from filename import function1, function2(import multiple functions)
from filename import * (import all the functions)
```



4.  The main difference between lists and a tuples is the fact that
    lists are mutable whereas tuples are immutable. A mutable data type
    means that a Python object of this type can be modified. Immutable
    means that a Python object of this type cannot be modified.
5.  You can\'t have a dict with duplicate keys, because in the backend
    it uses an hashing mechanism.
6.  `urllib` and `urllib2` are both Python modules
    that perform URL request related stuff but offer different
    functionalities.`urllib2` can accept a request object to
    set the headers for a URL request, `urllib` accepts only a
    URL. Python requests encode the parameters automatically so you just
    pass them as simple arguments.
