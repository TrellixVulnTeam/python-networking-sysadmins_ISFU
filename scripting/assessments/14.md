1.  Runtime exceptions occur during execution of the program and they
    exit abruptly in between. Compile time exceptions are those that are
    found before program executions start.
2.  A regular expression, regex, or regexp is a sequence of characters
    that define a search pattern. Usually this pattern is used by string
    searching algorithms for find or find and replace operations on
    strings, or for input validation.
3.  Here\'s a description of the Linux commands:
     {.itemizedlist}
    -   `head`: used to see the first N number of lines of
        plain files.
    -   `tail`: used to see the last N number of lines of
        plain files.
    -   `cat`: used to see the content of plain files.
    -   `awk`: AWK is a programming language designed for text
        processing and typically used as a data extraction and reporting
        tool. It is a standard feature of most Unix-like operating
        systems.
    
4.  Following is the answer:

```
def append(source, destination):
    with open(source, "a") as fw, open(destination,"r") as fr:
        fw.writelines(fr)
append(source_file_name1, file_name2)
```



5.  Following is the answer:

```
filename=input("Enter file name: ")
for line in reversed(list(open(filename))):
    print(line.rstrip())
```



6.  The output for the expressions are as follows:
    
    a.  `C@ke`
    b.  `Cooookie`
    c.  `<h1>`
