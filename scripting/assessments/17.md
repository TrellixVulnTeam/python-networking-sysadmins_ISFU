1.  NumPy\'s main object is the homogeneous multidimensional array. It
    is a table of elements (usually numbers), all of the same type,
    indexed by a tuple of positive integers. In NumPy, dimensions are
    called axes.
2.  Following is the output:

```
1st Input array : 
 [[ 1 2 3]
 [-1 -2 -3]]
2nd Input array : 
 [[ 4 5 6]
 [-4 -5 -6]]
Output stacked array :
 [[ 1 2 3 4 5 6]
 [-1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -6]]
```



3.  Following is the answer:

```
Z = np.arange(10)
np.add.reduce(Z)
```



4.  Following is the answer:

```
# Delete the rows with labels 0,1,5
data = data.drop([0,1,2], axis=0)
# Delete the first five rows using iloc selector
data = data.iloc[5:,]
#to delete the column
del df.column_name
```



5.  Following is the answer:

```
df.to_csv(“file_name.csv”,index=False, sep=”,”)
```


 

 


6.  [**Not a**][**number**] ([**NaN**]), such
    as a null value. Within pandas, a missing value is denoted by NaN.
7.  Following is the answer:

```
df.drop_duplicates()
```



8.  Following is the answer:

```
from matplotlib.pyplot import figure
figure(num=None, figsize=(8, 6), dpi=80, facecolor='w', edgecolor='k')
```



9.  Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn.
