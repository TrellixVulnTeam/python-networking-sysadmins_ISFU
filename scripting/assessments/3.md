Lab 3,Â Unit Testing -- Introduction to the Unit Testing Framework
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual
    units/components of the software are tested. The purpose is to
    validate that each unit of the software performs as designed.
    Automation testing is an automatic technique where the tester writes
    scripts on their own and uses suitable software to test the
    software. It is basically an automation process of a manual process.
    Manual testing is a process of finding out the defects or bugs in a
    software program. In this method, the tester plays an important role
    of end user and verifies that all the features of the application
    are working correctly.
2.  Unittest, mock, nose, `pytest`.
3.  A test case is a set of actions executed to verify a particular
    feature or functionality of your software application. This tutorial
    describes test case designing and the importance of its various
    components.
4.  PEP 8 is Python\'s style guide. It\'s a set of rules for how to
    format your Python code to maximize its readability. Writing code to
    a specification helps to make large code bases, with lots of
    writers. It is more uniform and predictable, too.
