Lab 4, Automating Regular Administrative Activities
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  The `readline()` method reads one entire line from the
    file. A trailing newline character is kept in the string. If the
    size argument is present and non-negative, it is a maximum byte
    count including the trailing newline, and an incomplete line may be
    returned.
2.  Reading: `cat`. Creating the new file : `touch`.
    Deletion of the file : `rm`. List the file in current
    directory: `ls`.
3.  Following is the answer:

```
os.system(“shell_command”)
subprocess.getstatusoutput(“shell_command”)
```



4.  Following is the answer:

```
import configparser as config
config.set(section, option, value)
```



5.  Following is the answer:

```
       psutil, fabric, salt, asnible, buildbot, shinken
```



6.  Following is the answer:

```
input() 
sys.stdin.readline()
```



7.  Use `list.sort()` when you want to mutate the list,
    `sorted()` when you want a new sorted object back. Use
    `sorted()` when you want to sort something that is an
    iterable, which is not a list yet. For lists,
    `list.sort()` is faster than `sorted()` because
    it doesn\'t have to create a copy.
