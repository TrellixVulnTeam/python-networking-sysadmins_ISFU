    actually stored in memory as a collection of series.
5.  List comprehensions provide a concise way to create new lists.

```
Set comprehension {s**2 for s in range(10)}
Dict comprehension {n: n**2 for n in range(5)}
```



7.  Following is the answer:

```
df.head(number of lines) default blank 
df.tail(number of lines) default blank

8.  Following is the answer:

```
