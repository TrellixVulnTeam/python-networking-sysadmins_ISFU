1.  The main difference is that when you use the `input` and
    `print` function, all the output formatting job is done

    including calls to `input()`; stdout is used for the
    output of `print()` and expression statements and for the
    prompts of `input()`.

    RFC 5321, which is the protocol in widespread use today.
