Lab 9,Â Working with Various Files
---------------------------------------------------------

1.  `f.readline()` reads a single line from the file; a
    newline character, (\\n), is left at the end of the string, and is
    only omitted on the last line of the file if the file doesn\'t end
    in a newline. If you want to read all the lines of a file in a list,
    you can also use `list(f)` or `f.readlines()`.
2.  Basically, using `with open()` just ensures that you
    don\'t forget to `close()` the file, making it
    safer/preventing memory issues.
3.  `r` means the string will be treated as raw string.
4.  Generators simplify the creation of iterators. A generator is a
    function that produces a sequence of results instead of a single
    value.
5.  The pass statement in Python is used when a statement is required
    syntactically but you do not want any command or code to execute.
    The pass statement is a null operation; nothing happens when it
    executes.



6.  In Python, an anonymous function is a function that is defined
    without a name. While normal functions are defined using the
    `def` keyword, in Python anonymous functions are defined
    using the `lambda` keyword. Hence, anonymous functions are
    also called lambda functions.
